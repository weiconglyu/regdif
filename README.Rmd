# Introduction

The goal of `regdif` is to detect differential item functioning (DIF) in two-parameter logistic (2PL) models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `regdif` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("weiconglyu/regdif")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to apply Gaussian variational estimation with importance sampling to the simulated data from the package:

```{r example}
library(regdif)
result <- with(regDIF_simdata, regDIF_GVEMM(Y, D, X))
```
